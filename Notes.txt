The ELements created using React.createElement are called React Element which is a JS Object and It will become as HTM ELement when rendered.
JSX is a HTML-like / XML-like syntax which is used to create React element in a simpler way which is then converted to ReactElement.
This transpilation is done by a package called Babel which we got from PARCEL.
React Componet has two types: Class based Component (OLD way) and Functional Component (NEW way)
Functional Component is a JavaScript fucntion whch return JSX.
React Component Composition is nothing but adding one react component inside another react component.
Inside React Component, we can evaluate JS Expressions by using curly braces.
Even console log works inside a curly braces inside a react component.
Adding one react elementinside another as well by usingjust curly braces.
Even you can add React component inside React element.
Even you can call react component as function as it is nothing but an arrow functions inside React component using curly braces. 
Normal JavaScript functions are also can be called inside React component but we should take care of the values returned by it.
Important note: JSX prevents code Ingestion (attacks).
